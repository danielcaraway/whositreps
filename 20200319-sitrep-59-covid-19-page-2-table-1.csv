"Study Protocol 
Objectives",""
"The First Few COVID-19 
cases and contacts 
transmission investigation 
protocol (FFX)","To provide descriptions and/or estimates of the: 
• 
clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease 
• 
secondary infection rate (SIR) and secondary clinical attack rate of COVID-19 
infection among close contacts (overall, and by key factors such as setting, age 
and sex, for various end-points) 
• 
serial interval of COVID-19 infection 
• 
symptomatic proportion of COVID-19 cases (through contact tracing and 
laboratory testing); and identification of possible routes of transmission"
"Households transmission 
of COVID-19 investigation 
protocol","• 
To better understand the extent of transmission within a household by estimating 
the secondary infection rate for household contacts at an individual level, and 
factors associated with any variation in the secondary infection risk 
• 
To characterize secondary cases including the range of clinical presentation, risk 
factors for infection, and the extent and fraction of asymptomatic infections 
• 
To characterize serologic response following confirmed COVID-19 infection"
"Assessment of COVID-19 
risk factors among Health 
workers protocol","• 
To better understand the extent of human-to-human transmission among health 
care workers, by estimating the secondary infection rate for health care worker 
contacts at an individual level 
• 
To characterize the range of clinical presentation of infection and the risk factors 
for infection among health care workers 
• 
To evaluate effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among 
health care workers"
"Surface sampling of 
COVID-19 for health care 
professionals","• 
To assess the extent and persistence of surface contamination with COVID-19 
virus 
• 
To identify environmental surfaces which may play a role in onwards transmission 
of COVID-19 infection"
"Population based 
serologic survey","• 
To estimate age-specific seroprevalence"
